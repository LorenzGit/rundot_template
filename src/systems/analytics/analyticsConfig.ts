/**
 * ADAPT: this is the game's funnel registry. Rename the steps to match the
 * derived game's actual first session — but keep the SHAPE:
 *
 *   - `ftue` has AT LEAST three steps: loaded -> first action -> first
 *     completion. A one-step boot funnel proves the app loaded and nothing
 *     else; it cannot show where onboarding loses players, which is the only
 *     reason to have a funnel. Prefer more, finer steps over fewer coarse ones.
 *   - `ftue` is `onceEver` so replays cannot re-fire step 1 and flatten the
 *     curve. Correct instrumentation reads monotonically decreasing.
 *   - Step names and numbers are FROZEN once deployed. Add new steps at the
 *     end; never renumber or rename a shipped one.

         * the tab during boot — or hit a load failure — never appeared in it at
         * all. That made a load regression look identical to a retention
         * problem. Step 1 fires on the first executable line, before any await,
         * and is buffered until the SDK transport is up.
         *
         * A separate funnel rather than steps prepended to `ftue`, because
         * `ftue` step numbers are frozen in games that already shipped.
