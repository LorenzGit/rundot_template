 * ADAPT: the reminder copy is the whole product here.
 *
 * Each body must name the specific thing waiting for this player in THIS game
 * — the daily reward that is ready, the streak about to lapse, the run they
 * left mid-way. A reminder that says "come back and play" is the one players
 * mute, and muting is permanent. Rewrite these three lines per game; do not
 * ship the template's wording.
 *
 * Cadence stops at 72h on purpose. A fourth ping converts nobody and costs the
 * notification permission that the first three depend on.
